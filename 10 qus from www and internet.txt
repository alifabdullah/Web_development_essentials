Ans (1)
The difference between the Internet and the World Wide Web is that the Internet is a massive network of networks, a networking infrastructure, while the World Wide Web is a way of accessing information over the medium of the internet. The Internet connects millions of computers together globally, while the World Wide Web is an information sharing model that is built on the top of the internet. The Internet uses Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), while the World Wide Web uses Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The Internet comprises fiber optic cables and wireless networks, while the World Wide Web comprises files, folders, and documents.

The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and servers that communicate with each other using standardized communication protocols. The Internet works by transmitting data packets between devices using the Internet Protocol (IP). When a user sends a request to access a website or any other online resource, the request is sent to the user's Internet Service Provider (ISP), which then forwards the request to the appropriate server. The server processes the request and sends the requested data back to the user's device, which is then displayed on the user's screen. This process is made possible by a complex system of routers, switches, and other networking equipment that directs data packets to their intended destinations. The Internet also relies on a system of domain names and IP addresses to identify and locate devices on the network.

some common Internet protocols and standards include HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), and DNS (Domain Name System). These protocols and standards are used to enable communication and data transfer between different devices and networks on the Internet. For example, HTTP is used to transfer web pages from a server to a user's browser, while FTP is used to exchange files over the Internet. TCP/IP is the underlying protocol that enables data transfer on the Internet, while DNS is used to translate domain names into IP addresses. Understanding these protocols and standards is essential for anyone who wants to work with the Internet and develop web applications or other Internet services.
